Here's a small app for mac users for making incremental backups of SD Deluge cards. Backups work somehow like macOS Time Machine: only modified files are actually stored, and all snapshots are kept distinct, so you can easily restore any of them. 

Backups are kept under user's Documents/Deluge-Backup folder. Just place the app on SD card root and launch it whenever you want a backup.

Please note that - in order to save space - not all samples are stored, but only the ones in SAMPLES/RESAMPLE plus every sample used in some song, synth or kit. 

To be absolutely safe please test this first with SD LOCK switch toggled ON ðŸ™‚
